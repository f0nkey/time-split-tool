<h3>Without this tool, there is a lot of paper and precision lost when recording start and stop times on paper.</h3>

        This tool was created after my frustration and laziness with dividing log time among items at work.

        Often times I will work on repairing multiple items. Some labor warrants dividing the time evenly among the items (such as gathering prerequisite items, or tools). The timer will divide every second evenly among sub-timers, where sub-timers relate to a single item.
