<h3>Without this tool, there is a lot of paper and precision lost when writing start and stop times on paper.</h3>

<div>
    <p>I work on multiple items at once sometimes, and need to divide the time up evenly.</p>
    <p>The way I work is in phases, one phase testing each item, then the next phase cleaning each item.</p>

    <p>I divide up the time I take testing each item evenly, since this can be done in bulk and relatively quickly (sometimes 2 minutes per item).<br>
        <i>This tool uses sub-timers to divide time up evenly amongst CNs being worked on right now.</i></p>
    <p>When the cleaning phase comes, I prefer to add the time for each individual item since this takes the most time.
        <br><i>This tool lets allows pausing of other sub-timers if you want all the time to go towards one-item, or only 3 out of 5 items if you prefer.</i></p>

    <p>Other times I jump back and forth between items when they are updating or loading, and need to pause and start times. There's plenty of use cases.</p>
