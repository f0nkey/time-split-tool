time-split-tool

Access the timer here: https://f0nkey.github.io/time-split-tool/

This tool was created after my frustration and laziness with dividing log time among items at work.

I often work on repairing multiple items.
Some labor warrants dividing the time evenly among the items (such as gathering prerequisite items, or tools). The timer will divide every second evenly among sub-timers, where sub-timers relate to a single item.

Styling the UI was not given much love here. The functionality being more important, and me being the only user.
